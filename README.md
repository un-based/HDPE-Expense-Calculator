# HDPE Expense Calculator
## Intro
This website/apk was designed to automate the process deciding rates based on specific order criterias. It also optimises the process of creating a quotation to a single click of a button. 

## HTML & CSS
The structure of HTML was just a template i picked up and edited to suit my needs. This is one of my first web-dev experiences so tried to keep it to the basics.
The styling on CSS was aimes at keeping the operational needs first. One easter egg is the use of the classic orange of blue of Indian Oil (yes, i actually found those hexcodes from a freakin book).

## JavaScript
So, this is the part I am most proud of. Without watching a single second of recorded yt tutorials, I figured out all the problems just using my new friend, Perplexity AI(got the free pro version, better put it to use). 
But as soon as the updates started to become trickier, Perplexity threw its hands up. That's where my old friend, stack overflow rushed in. 

The most challenging and rewarding part was to figure out how to automate the creation of a pdf from scratch without a template. Shoutout to MS Paint and Excel for always coming handy. The auto-generated pdf, is a quotation that exactly meets the companies requirements. 

## OUTRO
Special thanks to PKG for breaking my ankle, without your efforts, I would never have had the free-time to actually finish this.
